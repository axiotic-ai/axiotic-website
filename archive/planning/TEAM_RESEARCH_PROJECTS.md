# Team Research Project Clusters

This document outlines specific research directions for key team members, aligning their expertise with the Axiotic pillars.

## 1. Patryk Bartkowiak: Privacy-First Multimodal Systems
*   **Focus:** His work on EdgeWisePersona and video generation pipelines.
*   **Project Cluster:** **"The Private Edge Agent"**
    *   **Goal:** Train sub-1B multimodal models that can run entirely on-device (privacy-first) for smart home/personal assistant contexts.
    *   **Key Challenge:** Video/Audio generation and understanding on constrained compute (Efficient Architectures pillar).
    *   **Application:** A "Local Home Assistant" that understands video feeds without sending data to the cloud.

## 2. Thomas Woerhle: Open-Endedness & Neuro-Evolution
*   **Focus:** His PhD work on evolutionary methods.
*   **Project Cluster:** **"The Self-Designing Network"**
    *   **Goal:** Use evolutionary strategies to discover novel connectivity patterns (Pillar 5: Architectures) that gradient descent misses.
    *   **Key Challenge:** Scaling evolution to modern parameter counts (competitiveness with AdamW).
    *   **Application:** Automatically searching for the optimal "small model" architecture for a specific dataset.

## 3. Ruaridh (Placeholder)
*   **Role:** (To be defined - assuming Research Engineer/Scientist).
*   **Project Cluster:** **[TBD]**
    *   *Potential alignment:* Could focus on the **Embodiment** pillar (Isaac/Cosmos) or **Improved Tasks** (JEPA), pending profile details.
