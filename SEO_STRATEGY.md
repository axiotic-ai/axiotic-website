### Avoid
- "Axiotic.ai" as the brand name (use as domain only)
- Generic "AI company" or "AI startup"
- Overpromising on capabilities

## Measurement

### Key Metrics to Track
- Organic search impressions (Search Console)
- Click-through rate on brand vs non-brand queries

- As content grows, consider adding dedicated pages with proper internal linking
- JSON-LD structured data helps with rich snippets but content quality matters most
- The "beyond scaling" positioning is unique and ownable - double down on this
