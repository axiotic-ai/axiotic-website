  pillars:
    - icon: "🔮🎯"
      title: "Improved Tasks"
      description: "We move beyond next-token prediction. By training models to predict masked past, present, and future states, we force them to learn causal structure, long-horizon planning, and robust memory."
    - icon: "👁️👂🗣️🖐️"
      title: "Multimodal Learning"
      description: "Inspired by the brain's multimodal neurons, we design 'synesthetic' architectures that process text, images, and audio in a shared latent space, leveraging correlations across senses for richer world modeling."
    - icon: "🧠🔄"
      title: "Memory & Conditional Recursion"
      description: "Equipping transformers with explicit memory and latent reasoning loops could turn them into differentiable computers. This offers a path to infinite-context learning and efficient, internal recursion without expensive chain-of-thought tokens."

    - icon: "⚙️🚀"
      title: "AI Flywheels"
      description: "Data quality is the new frontier. We engineer closed-loop data engines where models generate, filter, and curriculum-sort their own training data for self-reinforcing improvement."
    - icon: "🤖🌍"
      title: "Embodiment"
      description: "Intelligence requires grounding. We use simulation (Isaac/Cosmos) as a primary data source, training agents on interaction physics before sim-to-real transfer."
    - icon: "🧬📉"
      title: "Evolution, Distillation"
      description: "SGD is greedy; evolution generalizes but is slow. We research how to synergize them for robust, efficient learning."
    - icon: "🧬📉"
      title: "Information Theory & Distillation"
      description: "We investigate distillation through an information-theoretic lens, aiming to crack the physics of compression and train small models to their maximum potential without a teacher."
  commitment:
    title: "Open Science Commitment"

  title: "Why 'Axiotic'?"
  text: "Pronounced <em>ak-see-OT-ik</em>. From the Greek root <em>axio-</em> (value, worth) and the suffix <em>-tic</em> (generating). <br><br>Axiotic describes something that creates value through alignment with deep principles. Not valuable in a shallow price-tag sense, but valuable because it coheres with a core truth. We strip away the noise to find the axioms of intelligence, building systems that are principled, value-generating, and orienting."
