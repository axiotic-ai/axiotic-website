  pillars:
    - icon: "fa-bullseye"
      title: "Improved Tasks"
      description: "We move beyond next-token prediction. By training models to predict masked past, present, and future states, we force them to learn causal structure, long-horizon planning, and robust memory."
    - icon: "fa-shapes"
      title: "Multimodal Learning"
      description: "Inspired by the brain's multimodal neurons, we design 'synesthetic' architectures that process text, images, and audio in a shared latent space, leveraging correlations across senses for richer world modeling."
    - icon: "fa-memory"
      title: "Memory & Conditional Recursion"
      description: "Equipping transformers with explicit memory and latent reasoning loops could turn them into differentiable computers. This offers a path to infinite-context learning and efficient, internal recursion without expensive chain-of-thought tokens."

      title: "Information Theory & Distillation"
      description: "We investigate distillation through an information-theoretic lens, aiming to crack the physics of compression and train small models to their maximum potential without a teacher."
    - icon: "fa-project-diagram"
      title: "Local Learning Rules"
      description: "Efficiency in nature is at least partially achieved through local learning rules. We research how to leverage this for efficient learning."
    - icon: "fa-wave-square"
      title: "Asynchronous Neural Dynamics"
      description: "Rhythms across multiple temporal scales are a defining feature of natural systems. We explore how neural architectures can internalize these rhythms for efficient learning, generalization, and inference."
    - icon: "fa-leaf"
      title: "Biologically Inspired Learning"
      description: "Nature has solved learning problems over billions of years. We draw inspiration from biological neural networks, synaptic plasticity, and adaptive mechanisms to design more efficient and robust learning algorithms."

      title: "Reputation Attracts Clients"
      description: "Our open work acts as a magnet. Companies want to work with the team that built the models they rely on, restarting the cycle."

name_origin:
  title: "Why the name 'Axiotic'?"
  text: "Pronounced <em>ak-see-OT-ik</em>. From the Greek root <em>axio-</em> (value, worth) and the suffix <em>-tic</em> (generating). <br><br>Axiotic describes something that creates value through alignment with deep principles. Not valuable in a shallow price-tag sense, but valuable because it coheres with a core truth. We strip away the noise to find the axioms of intelligence, building systems that are principled, value-generating, and orienting."
