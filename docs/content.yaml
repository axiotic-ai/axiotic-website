    subtitle: "We research the first principles of learning, how structure, interaction, and information theory can replace massive parameter counts."

  pillars:
    - icon: "fa-bullseye"
      title: "Better Tasks & Learning Signals"
      description: "We move beyond next token prediction by designing training objectives that force models to learn causality, long horizon structure, and planning. By predicting masked past, present, and future states, we shape learning signals that demand memory and abstraction rather than surface pattern matching."

    - icon: "fa-globe"
      title: "World Modelling"
      description: "We build grounded world models that learn the latent structure and dynamics of reality. Using multimodal learning and embodied interaction, often via simulation, we train systems that model causality, physics, and long term consequences rather than correlations in text."

    - icon: "fa-memory"
      title: "State, Beliefs & Memory"
      description: "Intelligence is inherently stateful. We design systems with persistent internal belief states, explicit memory, and conditional recursion, enabling infinite context learning and internal computation without relying on verbose chain of thought traces."

    - icon: "fa-sitemap"
      title: "Architectures & Hierarchical Attention"
      description: "Structure is not an implementation detail; it is fundamental to how and what a system learns. We explore new architectural primitives such as hierarchical and fractal attention, dense routing, and novel connectivity patterns, where computation is explicitly organized across depth and time, enabling capability to scale without brute force."

    - icon: "fa-dna"
      title: "Learning Dynamics Beyond Backprop"
      description: "Backpropagation is powerful but incomplete. We study alternative and complementary learning dynamics, including evolutionary methods, local learning rules, and asynchronous neural updates inspired by biological systems, to improve robustness, generalization, and efficiency."

    - icon: "fa-cogs"
      title: "AI Flywheels & Self Improvement"
      description: "Data must be endogenous. We engineer closed loop AI systems where models generate, evaluate, and curate their own training data, creating self reinforcing flywheels that tie deployment directly to continuous learning and improvement."

  commitment:
    title: "Open Science Commitment"
    text: "We release code, models, and datasets as openly as licensing allows. The lab exists to push the field forward, not to hide breakthroughs behind proprietary walls."

      title: "Research Builds Reputation"
      description: "We publish state of the art open source work. This builds technical authority and trust, and clients hire us because they trust our expertise."
    - icon: "fa-magnet"
      title: "Reputation Attracts Clients"
      description: "Our open work acts as a magnet. Companies want to work with the team that built the systems they rely on, restarting the cycle."

name_origin:
  title: "Why the name 'Axiotic'?"
  text: "Pronounced <em>ak see OT ik</em>. From the Greek root <em>axio</em> meaning value or worth, and the suffix <em>tic</em> meaning generating. <br><br>Axiotic describes something that creates value through alignment with deep principles. Not valuable in a shallow price tag sense, but valuable because it coheres with a core truth. We strip away the noise to find the axioms of intelligence, building systems that are principled, value generating, and orienting."
