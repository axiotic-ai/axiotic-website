    eyebrow: "Research Lab"
    title: "Open Research and Science on High Risk and High Value Next Generation AI Systems"
    subtitle: "We research the fundamental axioms of learning—how structure, interaction, and information theoretic principles can replace massive parameter counts."
  pillars:
    - icon: "fa-bullseye"
      title: "1. Improved Tasks"
      description: "We move beyond the next token prediction. By training models to predict masked past, present, and future states, we force them to learn causal structure, long-horizon planning, and robust memory."
    - icon: "fa-shapes"
      title: "2. Multimodal Learning"
      description: "Inspired by the brain's multimodal neurons, we design 'synesthetic' architectures that process text, images, and audio in a shared latent space, leveraging correlations across senses for richer world modeling."
    - icon: "fa-memory"
      title: "3. Memory & Conditional Recursion"
      description: "Equipping transformers with explicit memory and latent reasoning loops could turn them into differentiable computers that separate processing from storage. This offers a path to infinite-context learning and efficient, internal recursion without expensive chain-of-thought tokens."
    - icon: "fa-sitemap"
      title: "4. Hierarchical/Fractal Attention"
      description: "We develop fractal attention patterns that operate at multiple resolutions simultaneously—seeing the forest and the trees without the brute-force cost of standard scaling."
    - icon: "fa-cubes"
      title: "5. Architectures"
      description: "New connectivity patterns, different activation mechanisms, and dense routing schemes where deep layers attend directly to shallow features."
    - icon: "fa-cogs"
      title: "6. AI Flywheels"
      description: "Data quality is the new frontier. We engineer closed-loop data engines where models generate, filter, and curriculum-sort their own training data for self-reinforcing improvement."
    - icon: "fa-robot"
      title: "7. Embodiment"
      description: "Intelligence requires grounding. We use simulation (Isaac/Cosmos) as a primary data source, training agents on interaction physics before sim-to-real transfer."
    - icon: "fa-dna"
      title: "8. Evolution & Information"
      description: "SGD is greedy; evolution generalizes but is slow. We research how to synergize them for robust, efficient learning."
    - icon: "fa-compress"
      title: "9. Distillation"
      description: "We investigate distillation through an information-theoretic lens, aiming to crack the physics of compression and train small models to their maximum potential without a teacher."
    - icon: "fa-project-diagram"
      title: "10. Local Learning Rules"
      description: "Efficiency in nature is at least partially achieved through local learning rules. We research how to leverage this for efficient learning."
    - icon: "fa-wave-square"
      title: "11. Asynchronous Neural Dynamics"
      description: "Rhythms across multiple temporal scales are a defining feature of natural systems. We explore how neural architectures can internalize these rhythms for efficient learning, generalization, and inference."
  commitment:
    title: "Open Science Commitment"
    text: "We release code, models, and datasets as openly as licensing allows. The lab exists to push the field forward, not to hide breakthroughs behind proprietary walls."

  title: "Why 'Axiotic'?"
  text: "Pronounced <em>ak-see-OT-ik</em>. From the Greek root <em>axio-</em> (value, worth) and the suffix <em>-tic</em> (generating). <br><br>Axiotic describes something that creates value through alignment with deep principles. Not valuable in a shallow price-tag sense, but valuable because it coheres with a core truth. We strip away the noise to find the axioms of intelligence, building systems that are principled, value-generating, and orienting."
