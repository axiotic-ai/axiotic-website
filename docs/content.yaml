research:
  header:
    eyebrow: "Research Lab"
    title_line1: "Open Research and Science on"
    title_line2: "Next Generation AI Systems"
    subtitle: "We research the first-principles of learning—how structure, interaction, and information theory can replace massive parameter counts."
  pillars:
  - icon: "fa-bullseye"
    title: "Better Tasks & Learning Signals"
    description: "We move beyond next-token prediction by designing training objectives that force models to learn causality, long-horizon structure, and planning. By predicting masked past, present, and future states, we shape learning signals that demand memory and abstraction rather than surface pattern matching."

  - icon: "fa-globe"
    title: "World Modelling"
    description: "We build grounded world models that learn the latent structure and dynamics of reality. Using multimodal learning and embodied interaction—often via simulation—we train systems that model causality, physics, and long-term consequences rather than correlations in text."

  - icon: "fa-memory"
    title: "State, Beliefs & Memory"
    description: "Intelligence is inherently stateful. We design systems with persistent internal belief states, explicit memory, and conditional recursion—enabling infinite-context learning and internal computation without relying on verbose chain-of-thought traces."

  - icon: "fa-sitemap"
    title: "Architectures & Hierarchical Attention"
    description: "Structure is not an implementation detail; it is fundamental to how and what a system learns. We explore new architectural primitives—hierarchical and fractal attention, dense routing, and novel connectivity patterns—where computation is explicitly organized across depth and time, enabling capability to scale without brute force."

  - icon: "fa-dna"
    title: "Learning Dynamics Beyond Backprop"
    description: "Backpropagation is powerful but incomplete. We study alternative and complementary learning dynamics, including evolutionary methods, local learning rules, and asynchronous neural updates inspired by biological systems, to improve robustness, generalization, and efficiency."

  - icon: "fa-cogs"
    title: "AI Flywheels & Self-Improvement"
    description: "Data must be endogenous. We engineer closed-loop AI systems where models generate, evaluate, and curate their own training data—creating self-reinforcing flywheels that tie deployment directly to continuous learning and improvement."

  commitment:
    title: "Open Science Commitment"
    text: "We release code, models, and datasets as openly as licensing allows. The lab exists to push the field forward, not to hide breakthroughs behind proprietary walls."

    - icon: "fa-flask"
      title: "Revenue Funds Research"
      description: "We reinvest profits into 'blue sky' exploration—new architectures, evolution, and embodied AI—without needing immediate ROI."
    - icon: "fa-star"
      title: "Research Builds Reputation"
      description: "We publish SOTA open-source work. This builds technical authority and trust: clients hire us because they use our tools."
    - icon: "fa-magnet"
      title: "Reputation Attracts Clients"
      description: "Our open work acts as a magnet. Companies want to work with the team that built the models they rely on, restarting the cycle."

name_origin:
  title: "Why the name 'Axiotic'?"
  text: "Pronounced <em>ak-see-OT-ik</em>. From the Greek root <em>axio-</em> (value, worth) and the suffix <em>-tic</em> (generating). <br><br>Axiotic describes something that creates value through alignment with deep principles. Not valuable in a shallow price-tag sense, but valuable because it coheres with a core truth. We strip away the noise to find the axioms of intelligence, building systems that are principled, value-generating, and orienting."

You get a clear, honest view of where AI can help, where it won’t, and what it would take to build systems that actually work. As part of this, we run a focused AI governance audit to surface compliance, privacy, and ethical risks."
