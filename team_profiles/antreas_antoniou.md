# Antreas Antoniou
**Role:** Technical Vision & Research Lead
**Flywheel Function:** Drives the "Open Science" innovation engine. Translates "impossible" research benchmarks (e.g., massive context on single GPU) into deployable client solutions.

## Focus Areas
*   **Multi-Modal Learning:** Early fusion architectures for text, image, audio, and video.
*   **Efficient LLMs:** On-device models (20-80M params) with sub-100ms inference.
*   **High-Performance RAG:** Systems querying millions of vectors in <20ms.
*   **Evolutionary AI:** Neuro-evolution and population-based training for architecture search.

## Background & Experience
**Principal Research Scientist & Head of ML Research @ Pieces.App (2025-Present)**
*   Led research on small-scale language models matching oracle performance.
*   Supervised design of ultra-low latency RAG systems and evolutionary deep research reports.
*   Spearheaded "massive-context" model training on single GPUs.

**Senior ML Research Scientist @ Malted AI (2024-2025)**
*   Developed recipes for LLM fine-tuning, synthetic data generation (teacher committees), and automated prompt optimization.
*   Researched model distillation techniques to compress 8B+ models into sub-600M architectures.
*   Built frameworks for committee-based decision making and ensemble integration.

**Research Associate @ University of Edinburgh (2021-2024)**
*   Focused on Data-Efficient, Highly Transferable, and Robust Generalization Learning.
*   Mentored research teams and rewrote core codebases for efficiency and adaptability.
*   Created GATE (Generalization benchmark) and TALI (Quadra-modal dataset).

**Research Intern @ Google (2020-2021)**
*   Enhanced transferability of few-shot learning systems under extreme domain shift.

**PhD in Machine Learning @ University of Edinburgh (2017-2021)**
*   Thesis: "Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Learning."
*   Published key works on MAML++ (How to Train Your MAML) and unsupervised meta-learning.

## Awards & Teaching
*   **LeRobot Global Hackathon (2025):** 7th Place International Finish; Organizer of the Edinburgh node.
*   **Teaching Awards:** 5 Nominations at UoE (Best Support Staff, Best Student Who Tutors).
*   **Open Source:** Top-3 Finalist in UK Open Source Awards for MAML++ framework.
*   **Lecturing:** Designed and delivered "Accelerated Deep Learning Fundamentals" courses; Guest Lecturer on Model Compression.

## Open Source & Projects
*   **GATE & TALI:** Benchmarks and datasets for robust multi-modal representation learning.
*   **MAML++:** A stable, user-friendly framework for meta-learning.
*   **Kubejobs:** Python tooling for simplifying Kubernetes cluster management.
*   **DAGAN:** Data Augmentation Generative Adversarial Networks for low-data regimes.
